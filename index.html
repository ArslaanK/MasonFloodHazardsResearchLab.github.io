: iFLOOD: An Integrated Framework for Real Time Flood Forecast For Total Water Modeling

Research and educational systems supporting the development of the next generation of real time flood forecast systems, capable of providing accurate, timely and reliable information to support emergency management and response in areas impacted by multi-flood hazards. 

Our students are working on the complex dynamics of multi-flood hazards including storm surges, riverine flow, tidal oscillation and urban storm water systems. Our final goal is to develop integrated computational tools capable of predicting the total water levels resulting from the interaction of these systems in real time and into the future.

The products provided here are for educational and scientific research only and should not be used for decision making in its present form. The models, methods and results published here are under constant testing, development and subject to educational and training exercises on real time.
